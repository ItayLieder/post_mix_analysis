# Project Structure - Clean and Organized

## ‚úÖ Root Directory (19 core files)
Only files that are directly imported by the notebooks remain in root:

### Files used by `mixing_session_simple.ipynb`:
- `mixing_engine.py` - Core mixing system
- `channel_recognition.py` - Channel type identification
- `mix_templates.py` - Genre-specific templates
- `dsp_premitives.py` - DSP functions (imported by mixing_engine)

### Files used by `post_mix_cleaned.ipynb`:
- `mastering_orchestrator.py` - Mastering pipeline
- `config.py` - Configuration settings
- `analysis.py` - Audio analysis tools
- `audio_utils.py` - Audio utilities
- `comparison_reporting.py` - Comparison reports
- `data_handler.py` - Data management
- `logging_versioning.py` - Logging system
- `pre_master_prep.py` - Pre-mastering preparation
- `presets_recommendations.py` - Preset management
- `processors.py` - Processing modules
- `render_engine.py` - Rendering system
- `stem_mastering.py` - Stem mastering tools

## üìÅ Organized Folders

### `controls/` - Clean Balance Control System
- `balance_control.py` - The single, clean balance control solution

### `examples/` (6 files)
All example and demo scripts moved here

### `tests/` (8 files)  
All test scripts moved here

### `legacy/` (24 files)
All failed GUI attempts and old balance control scripts archived here

### `processing/` (6 files)
Additional processing modules not directly imported by notebooks

### `utils/` (2 files)
Helper utilities and reload scripts

## üéØ Results

- **Before**: 53 files cluttering the root directory
- **After**: 19 essential files in root, 34 files organized into folders
- **Notebooks**: Both work perfectly with no changes needed
- **Safety**: Nothing deleted, only reorganized

## üí° Usage

Your notebooks work exactly as before:
- Just run the notebooks normally
- All imports will work
- Nothing has been deleted, only reorganized

For new balance control, use:
```python
from controls.balance_control import create_balance_controls
```

## üõ°Ô∏è What's Preserved

- ‚úÖ `mixing_session_simple.ipynb` - Untouched and working
- ‚úÖ `post_mix_cleaned.ipynb` - Untouched and working  
- ‚úÖ All core functionality
- ‚úÖ All old code (in legacy/ folder)
