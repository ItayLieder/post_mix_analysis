# WHAT MAKES THESE "EXTREME"?
# ============================================

"""
üéØ IMPOSSIBLE WITH SINGLE STEREO FILES:

1. 3D POSITIONING:
   - Kick drum positioned below listener
   - Hi-hats floating above left ear
   - Strings in a dome overhead
   - Guitar moving through VR space
   ‚Üí Can't position individual elements in a mixed file!

2. AI-DRIVEN INTERACTIONS:
   - Bass learns to duck based on kick patterns
   - Vocals anticipate and duck the music before singing
   - Neural networks decide frequency relationships
   - Quantum probability affects processing decisions
   ‚Üí No way to analyze individual elements in a mix!

3. TEMPO-SYNCHRONIZED:
   - Filter sweeps locked to exact BPM
   - Polyrhythmic patterns between stems
   - Breakbeat chopping of specific elements
   - Trance gating on pads only
   ‚Üí Can't apply tempo effects to specific elements!

4. SPECTRAL MORPHING:
   - Kick drum gets bass harmonics
   - Vocals modulate synth timbres
   - Hi-hats get vocal formants
   - Guitar and keys swap frequency content
   ‚Üí Impossible to morph specific elements in a mix!

5. PSYCHOACOUSTIC TRICKS:
   - Missing fundamental on bass only
   - Haas effect on vocals only
   - Fletcher-Munson optimization per stem
   - Subliminal harmonics on specific instruments
   ‚Üí Can't target psychoacoustic tricks to specific content!

‚ö†Ô∏è CPU INTENSITY LEVELS:

Basic Variants:      ‚ñà (very light)
Advanced Variants:   ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà (moderate)
Extreme Variants:    ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà (very heavy!)

Extreme processing includes:
‚Ä¢ Real-time 3D spatial calculations
‚Ä¢ FFT-based spectral analysis/morphing  
‚Ä¢ AI-inspired adaptive algorithms
‚Ä¢ Tempo-synchronized modulation
‚Ä¢ Psychoacoustic enhancement

If processing is too slow:
1. Reduce number of extreme variants
2. Set CONFIG.pipeline.use_extreme_stem_processing = False
3. Use only a few specific extreme variants
4. Process shorter audio segments for testing

For full tracks, expect:
‚Ä¢ Basic: ~30 seconds processing
‚Ä¢ Advanced: ~2-3 minutes processing  
‚Ä¢ Extreme: ~5-10 minutes processing (depends on track length)

# ============================================
# BEST USE CASES
# ============================================

"""
üéß RECOMMENDED USAGE:

For LANDR/External Mastering:
‚Ä¢ Use 1-3 extreme variants max
‚Ä¢ Focus on "Subliminal_Adaptive" or "Cinematic_AI"
‚Ä¢ These create superior source material without being too weird

For Creative Projects:
‚Ä¢ Try "Neural_Trance" or "Quantum_Club" 
‚Ä¢ Use "Breakbeat_Morph" for electronic music
‚Ä¢ "VR_Experience" for game soundtracks

For Headphone Listening:
‚Ä¢ "Binaural_Psycho" optimized for headphones
‚Ä¢ "3D_Immersive" for incredible spatial experience
‚Ä¢ "Subliminal" for subtle but profound improvements

For Mixing Analysis:
‚Ä¢ Run extreme variants to hear stem relationships
‚Ä¢ "AI_Cinematic" reveals interaction possibilities
‚Ä¢ "Spectral_Morph" shows frequency masking
