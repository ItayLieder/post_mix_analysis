Example: Using Detailed Stems in Post-Mix Analysis

This demonstrates how to use the new detailed stem feature that supports
specific stems like "kick", "backvocals", etc. with fallback to main categories.

# Example usage in your notebook configuration cell:

# ============================================
# DETAILED STEM PATHS CONFIGURATION
# ============================================

# Option 1: Mix of main stems and detailed stems
STEM_PATHS = {
    # Main stem categories (if you have full stems)
    "bass": "/path/to/bass.wav",
    "vocals": "/path/to/main_vocals.wav",  # This will be used if no detailed vocals
    
    # Detailed drum stems (instead of one drums.wav)
    "kick": "/path/to/kick.wav",
    "snare": "/path/to/snare.wav", 
    "hats": "/path/to/hats.wav",
    
    # Detailed vocal stems (will override main vocals if present)
    "leadvocals": "/path/to/lead_vocals.wav",
    "backvocals": "/path/to/backing_vocals.wav",
    
    # Detailed music stems
    "guitar": "/path/to/guitars.wav",
    "keys": "/path/to/keys.wav",
    "strings": "/path/to/strings.wav",
}

# Option 2: Only detailed stems (no main categories)
STEM_PATHS_DETAILED_ONLY = {
    "kick": "/path/to/kick.wav",
    "snare": "/path/to/snare.wav",
    "bass": "/path/to/bass.wav", 
    "leadvocals": "/path/to/lead_vox.wav",
    "backvocals": "/path/to/bg_vox.wav",
    "guitar": "/path/to/guitar.wav",
    "keys": "/path/to/synths.wav"
}

# DETAILED STEM BALANCE CONTROL
# ============================================

from stem_balance_helper import set_stem_balance

# Method 1: Set specific detailed stems
set_stem_balance(
    kick=0.90,          # Kick drum loud and punchy
    snare=0.75,         # Snare controlled

    guitar=0.80,        # Guitar present but not dominating

# PROCESSING BEHAVIOR
# ============================================

"""
How the system handles detailed stems:

1. If you provide "kick.wav", it gets processed as a "kick" stem
   - Uses kick-specific gain (0.80 by default)
   - Gets kick-specific DSP processing (drums category variants)
   - Falls back to drums category if kick gain not specified

2. If you provide "drums.wav" (no kick.wav), it gets processed as "drums"
   - Uses drums gain (0.75 by default)
   - Gets general drums DSP processing

3. Mixing is intelligent:
   - kick + snare + hats = summed with individual gains
   - OR drums = processed as one stem
   - System prevents double-processing the same content

4. Categories for detailed stems:
   kick, snare, hats ‚Üí drums category
   leadvocals, backvocals ‚Üí vocals category  
   guitar, keys, strings ‚Üí music category
   bass ‚Üí bass category (no subcategories yet)
