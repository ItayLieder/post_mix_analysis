# HOW IT'S DIFFERENT FROM REGULAR DEPTH
# ============================================

"""
ðŸŽµ MUSICAL vs REGULAR DEPTH:

REGULAR DEPTH (too much):
â€¢ Distance differences: 0.3x to 3.0x (10x range!)
â€¢ EQ changes: up to -5dB (very noticeable)
â€¢ Reflections: up to 25% wet (obvious)
â€¢ Can sound processed/artificial

MUSICAL DEPTH (just right):
â€¢ Distance differences: 0.65x to 1.40x (2x range)
â€¢ EQ changes: max Â±1dB (subtle)
â€¢ Reflections: max 10% wet (barely noticeable)
â€¢ Sounds like natural studio acoustics

RESULT: Professional depth without weirdness!

# Example 1: Just add musical depth to your current setup
CONFIG.pipeline.stem_combinations = [
    # Your current favorites
    ("Original", "natural"),
    ("RadioReady", "advanced:RadioReady"),
    
    # Add musical depth versions
    ("RadioReady_WithDepth", "musical:balanced"),    # THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT!
    ("RadioReady_VocalFocus", "musical:vocal_forward"),

# Example 2: Compare subtle vs dramatic depth
CONFIG.pipeline.stem_combinations = [
    ("Flat_Original", "natural"),           # No depth
    ("Musical_Depth", "musical:balanced"),  # Subtle depth (recommended)  
    ("Dramatic_Depth", "depth:dramatic"),   # Too much (for comparison)
]

# Example 3: Multiple musical depth styles

    ("Musical_Balanced", "musical:balanced"),    # General purpose
    ("Musical_Clear", "musical:clear"),          # For busy mixes

# WHAT YOU'LL HEAR

"""
ðŸŽ§ BEFORE vs AFTER (Musical Depth):

BEFORE (flat):
â€¢ All elements at same perceived distance
â€¢ Mix sounds good but lacks dimension
â€¢ Professional but somewhat flat

AFTER (musical depth):
â€¢ Vocals gently forward (not in-your-face)
â€¢ Music elements subtly layered behind
â€¢ Still sounds like YOUR mix, just with more space
â€¢ Professional dimension like expensive studio
â€¢ Maintains all your balance choices
â€¢ Ready for LANDR with better source material

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:
â€¢ Better front-to-back separation
â€¢ Enhanced stereo image (subtle)
â€¢ Reduced frequency conflicts
â€¢ More engaging listening experience
â€¢ Commercial-ready enhancement
"""

# ============================================
# PERFECT FOR LANDR USERS
# ============================================

"""
ðŸŽ¯ WHY MUSICAL DEPTH + LANDR = PERFECT:

Your Current Workflow:
Stems â†’ Balance â†’ LANDR â†’ Final Master

New Improved Workflow:  
Stems â†’ Balance â†’ Musical Depth â†’ LANDR â†’ Superior Master

What LANDR Gets:
â€¢ Your carefully balanced mix (unchanged)
â€¢ PLUS professional spatial positioning
â€¢ PLUS subtle dimension enhancement
â€¢ PLUS better stereo information
â€¢ = Superior source material for mastering

Result: LANDR produces better masters because it starts with better source!

The musical depth processing is like having a professional mixing engineer 
add subtle depth to your mix before sending to mastering.
