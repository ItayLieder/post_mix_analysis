Depth Processing Examples - Transform flat mixes into dimensional soundscapes

Perfect for mixes that sound flat, lifeless, or lack spatial dimension.

# ============================================
# THE PROBLEM: FLAT MIXES
# ============================================

"""
üéß COMMON MIXING PROBLEM: Everything sounds flat and in-your-face

Symptoms:
‚Ä¢ All instruments seem at the same distance
‚Ä¢ No sense of space or dimension
‚Ä¢ Mix sounds cramped and 2D
‚Ä¢ Elements compete for the same spatial position
‚Ä¢ Lacks the depth of professional recordings

Traditional solutions are limited:
‚Ä¢ Reverb on the whole mix makes everything muddy
‚Ä¢ EQ can't position individual elements
‚Ä¢ Pan only moves things left-right, not front-back
‚Ä¢ Single stereo file prevents individual positioning

SOLUTION: Stem-based depth processing!
"""

# ============================================
# DEPTH VARIANTS AVAILABLE
# ============================================

"""
üèûÔ∏è DEPTH PROCESSING VARIANTS:

1. Depth_Natural
   ‚Ä¢ Realistic front-to-back positioning
   ‚Ä¢ Vocals forward, drums close, music mid-distance, strings back
   ‚Ä¢ Subtle early reflections and natural HF rolloff
   ‚Üí Most mixes benefit from this

2. Depth_Dramatic  
   ‚Ä¢ Exaggerated depth for dramatic effect
   ‚Ä¢ Vocals very close, strings very distant
   ‚Ä¢ Strong distance cues and atmospheric reverb
   ‚Üí Great for cinematic or ambient music

3. Depth_Intimate
   ‚Ä¢ Everything relatively close but with subtle layering
   ‚Ä¢ Creates cozy, personal listening experience
   ‚Ä¢ Gentle depth cues without pushing anything too far
   ‚Üí Perfect for acoustic, folk, or intimate productions

4. Depth_Stadium
   ‚Ä¢ Large space feeling with distant elements
   ‚Ä¢ Simulates live venue acoustics
   ‚Ä¢ Everything pushed back except vocals
   ‚Üí Great for live albums or stadium rock feel

5. Depth_VocalFocus
   ‚Ä¢ Vocals way forward, everything else pushed back
   ‚Ä¢ Maximum clarity for vocal-driven tracks
   ‚Ä¢ Creates strong foreground/background separation
   ‚Üí Perfect for pop, R&B, or podcast/spoken word

# HOW IT WORKS (THE SCIENCE)
# ============================================

"""
üß† DEPTH PERCEPTION CUES:

1. VOLUME ATTENUATION
   ‚Ä¢ Distant sounds are quieter (inverse square law)
   ‚Ä¢ But musical scaling - we don't make things disappear!
   
2. HIGH FREQUENCY ROLLOFF  
   ‚Ä¢ Air absorbs high frequencies over distance
   ‚Ä¢ Distant elements lose sparkle and brightness
   ‚Ä¢ Close elements can get presence boost

3. EARLY REFLECTIONS
   ‚Ä¢ Room reflections arrive after direct sound
   ‚Ä¢ More reflections = more distance perception
   ‚Ä¢ Different patterns for different instruments

4. REVERB/AMBIENCE
   ‚Ä¢ Distant sources have more reverb
   ‚Ä¢ Simulates room acoustics naturally
   ‚Ä¢ Tailored to instrument characteristics

5. SPECTRAL TILT
   ‚Ä¢ Distance = less high frequencies
   ‚Ä¢ Closeness = more presence/brightness
   ‚Ä¢ Creates natural depth gradient

6. STEREO WIDTH EFFECTS
   ‚Ä¢ Mid-side processing for depth
   ‚Ä¢ Haas effect (precedence) for positioning
   ‚Ä¢ Different delays create front-back illusion

# Example 1: Just add natural depth (recommended starting point)
CONFIG.pipeline.stem_combinations = [
    ("Stem_Original", "natural"),           # Reference
    ("Stem_WithDepth", "depth:natural"),    # Natural depth added

# Example 2: Compare different depth styles
CONFIG.pipeline.stem_combinations = [
    ("Stem_Natural", "depth:natural"),      # Realistic
    ("Stem_Dramatic", "depth:dramatic"),    # Exaggerated  
    ("Stem_Intimate", "depth:intimate"),    # Close and cozy
    ("Stem_Stadium", "depth:stadium"),      # Big space
    ("Stem_VocalFocus", "depth:focused"),   # Vocals forward
]

# Example 3: Combine with other processing
CONFIG.pipeline.stem_combinations = [
    # Basic with depth
    ("Stem_PunchyDepth", "depth:dramatic"),
    
    # Advanced with depth (best of both worlds!)
    ("Stem_RadioDepth", "advanced:RadioReady"),

üìç TYPICAL DEPTH POSITIONING:

NATURAL variant distances:
‚Ä¢ Bass: 0.7x (very close for impact)
‚Ä¢ Lead Vocals: 0.6x (forward and intimate) 
‚Ä¢ Kick: 0.8x (close but not too close)
‚Ä¢ Snare: 0.9x (slightly behind kick)
‚Ä¢ Guitar: 1.2x (mid-distance)
‚Ä¢ Keys: 1.4x (slightly back)
‚Ä¢ Backing Vocals: 1.5x (back for contrast)
‚Ä¢ Strings: 1.8x (far back, atmospheric)

DRAMATIC variant:

‚Ä¢ Lead Vocals: 0.3x (right in your face)
‚Ä¢ Backing Vocals: 2.5x (very distant)
‚Ä¢ Strings: 3.0x (very far atmospheric)

INTIMATE variant:
‚Ä¢ Everything closer together
‚Ä¢ More subtle depth differences
‚Ä¢ Creates cozy listening experience

STADIUM variant:
‚Ä¢ Everything pushed back
‚Ä¢ Simulates large venue acoustics
‚Ä¢ Vocals still forward for clarity

VOCAL_FOCUS variant:
‚Ä¢ Vocals: 0.3x (way forward)
‚Ä¢ Everything else: 1.8x+ (way back)
‚Ä¢ Maximum vocal clarity

# BEFORE/AFTER COMPARISON
# ============================================

"""
üéß WHAT YOU'LL HEAR:

BEFORE (flat mix):
‚Ä¢ All elements at same perceived distance
‚Ä¢ Sounds like everything recorded in same room
‚Ä¢ Lacks professional polish and dimension
‚Ä¢ Elements fight for same spatial position
‚Ä¢ Mix feels cramped and 2D

AFTER (depth processed):
‚Ä¢ Clear front-to-back layering
‚Ä¢ Vocals float in front of the mix
‚Ä¢ Drums feel close and impactful
‚Ä¢ Music elements create spatial backdrop
‚Ä¢ Mix has professional 3D dimension
‚Ä¢ Each element has its own space
‚Ä¢ Sounds like expensive studio production

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:
‚Ä¢ Better separation between elements
‚Ä¢ Reduced frequency masking
‚Ä¢ Enhanced stereo image
‚Ä¢ More engaging listening experience
‚Ä¢ Professional spatial hierarchy
"""

# ============================================
# BEST PRACTICES
# ============================================

"""
üí° RECOMMENDATIONS:

For Most Mixes:
‚Ä¢ Start with "depth:natural" 
‚Ä¢ Compare with original to hear difference
‚Ä¢ Try "depth:dramatic" if you want more effect

For Specific Genres:
‚Ä¢ Pop/R&B: "depth:focused" (vocal emphasis)
‚Ä¢ Rock/Metal: "depth:stadium" (big space feel)
‚Ä¢ Acoustic/Folk: "depth:intimate" (cozy feel)
‚Ä¢ Electronic: "depth:dramatic" (creative effects)
‚Ä¢ Cinematic: "depth:dramatic" or "depth:stadium"

For LANDR/External Mastering:
‚Ä¢ Use "depth:natural" or "depth:intimate"
‚Ä¢ Avoid overly dramatic effects
‚Ä¢ Depth processing improves source material significantly

Performance Notes:
‚Ä¢ Depth processing is light on CPU
‚Ä¢ Much faster than extreme variants
‚Ä¢ Can be used on all mixes safely
‚Ä¢ No strange artifacts or weird effects

"""
üöÄ HOW TO USE:

1. Add depth variants to your stem combinations:
   CONFIG.pipeline.stem_combinations.append(
       ("My_Mix_WithDepth", "depth:natural")
   )

2. Run your stem processing as normal - depth variants auto-detected!

3. Compare results:
   ‚Ä¢ Original mix (flat)
   ‚Ä¢ Depth processed (dimensional)
   
4. Send depth-processed versions to LANDR for superior mastering!

The depth processing gives LANDR source material with:
‚Ä¢ Professional spatial positioning
‚Ä¢ Natural front-to-back layering  
‚Ä¢ Enhanced stereo information
‚Ä¢ Reduced element conflicts
‚Ä¢ Better separation for mastering algorithms
