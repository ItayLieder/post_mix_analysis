from controls.balance_control import create_balance_controls, quick_balance

# Quick preset option (uncomment one):
# channel_overrides = quick_balance(channels, drums=4.0, vocals=0.3, bass=1.5)  # Drum power
# channel_overrides = quick_balance(channels, vocals=2.0, drums=0.5)  # Vocal focus

# Interactive control system
controls = create_balance_controls(channels)

# Apply your balance adjustments
controls.boost_drums(4.0)      # Make drums 4x louder
controls.reduce_vocals(0.3)    # Make vocals 30% volume  
controls.boost_bass(1.5)       # Make bass 1.5x louder

# Get the overrides for mixing engine
channel_overrides = controls.get_overrides()

# Show what we've set
controls.show()

print(f"\n‚úÖ Balance ready: {len(channel_overrides)} channels modified")
