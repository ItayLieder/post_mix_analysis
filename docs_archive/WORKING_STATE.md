# Working State Documentation

## ✅ What's Working

### Core Mixing System
- `mixing_engine.py` - Fully functional mixing engine
- `dsp_premitives.py` - DSP processing functions  
- `channel_recognition.py` - Channel type detection
- `mix_templates.py` - Genre templates

### Notebooks
- `mixing_session_simple.ipynb` - Main mixing notebook
  - Cell 10: Manual balance control (fallback)
  - Cell 12: Session configuration
  - Cell 14: Mix processing
- `post_mix_cleaned.ipynb` - Post-processing notebook

## 🎚️ New Balance Control System

### Location
`controls/balance_control.py` - Single clean solution

### How to Use in Notebook

```python
# Option 1: Quick one-liner
from controls.balance_control import quick_balance
channel_overrides = quick_balance(channels, drums=4.0, vocals=0.3, bass=1.5)

# Option 2: Interactive controls
from controls.balance_control import create_balance_controls
controls = create_balance_controls(channels)
controls.boost_drums(4.0)
controls.reduce_vocals(0.3)
channel_overrides = controls.get_overrides()
```

### Features
- Works with ANY channels (dynamic discovery)
- No GUI dependencies
- Simple function interface
- Presets available
- Clean code generation

## 📁 Directory Structure

```
post_mix_analysis/
├── controls/
│   └── balance_control.py      # Clean balance solution
├── legacy/                      # Old GUI attempts (archived)
├── mixing_engine.py            # Core engine (don't touch)
├── mixing_session_simple.ipynb # Main notebook
└── post_mix_cleaned.ipynb      # Post-processing
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Manual override in cell 10 still works** - Keep as fallback
2. **Don't modify mixing_engine.py** - It's working perfectly
3. **Legacy folder** - Contains all failed GUI attempts for reference
4. **Balance control** - Use the new clean system in `controls/`

## 🔧 If Something Breaks

1. Use manual balance in cell 10 (always works)
2. Check that `channel_overrides` variable is set
3. Ensure it's a dictionary with channel IDs as keys
4. Values should be 0.1 to 5.0 (1.0 is neutral)

## 📊 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Channels load correctly
- [ ] Balance controls create `channel_overrides`
- [ ] Session configuration accepts overrides
- [ ] Mix processing applies the overrides
- [ ] Output file has correct balance
